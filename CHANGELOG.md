# Changelog

All notable changes to YTArk are recorded here, newest first.

This file is the single source for the in-app **Changelog / What's new** reader
(generated into `TizenTube/mods/assets/changelog.generated.js` by
`python3 tools/build_changelog.py --write`, checked in CI with `--check`) and for
the "What changed in this release" section of each GitHub release
(`tools/render_release_notes.sh`).

Conventions:

- Each published version links its GitHub release. Dates and times are the
  GitHub publication time in UTC, taken from the release records.
- Each version opens with one short, user-facing summary line; the in-app
  reader shows it as `<version> — <summary>` (for example
  "2.6 — Added Full Auto Updating").
- "Unreleased" marks changes in this source tree that have not been published.
- Nothing is described as tested on a physical TV unless a device run is
  recorded (see `docs/RUNTIME-CHECKLIST.md`).
- Capabilities inherited from TizenTube and TizenTubeCobalt are listed under
  "Upstream base and inherited capabilities", not as YTArk additions.

## [2.9.1] — Unreleased

> Not yet published. Planned tag `v2.9.1` · versionCode 2090100 · userscript `s29` · one ARMv7 APK (armeabi-v7a) on TizenTubeCobalt v2.0.2. This is intended as a direct, signed in-place update to published 2.8.0; package ID, signing identity and app data directory stay unchanged.

Safer updater recovery and theme-aware screen routes.

### Added
- **Screen-only Updates and Storage URI contracts.** The userscript emits only `ytark://updates` or `ytark://storage`, with optional `theme=oled` or `theme=youtube`. A separate public Leanback launcher proxy opens Updates; exported screen routes require YTArk's app-signature permission and accept only the matching URI. Static tests cover URL assignment and manifest declarations; dispatch from pinned Cobalt to Android remains unverified.

### Changed
- **Native screens follow a validated theme value.** Updates and Storage persist only `oled` or `youtube` when a valid matching route arrives; YouTube's theme, playback and app data are not changed.
- **Update-file cleanup preserves pending and resumable candidates.** Deletion stays in YTArk's private update directory, rejects symlink/path escapes, and requires explicit confirmation in Storage.
- **Release redirects and partial-download resumes are revalidated.** Every redirect hop stays on the exact HTTPS allowlist; resume requires matching URL, digest, size and ABI metadata.
- **Foreground updater checks share persisted cadence and single-flight work.** Android may defer background jobs; explicit automatic-check and download opt-outs remain respected.
- Search text entry keeps the field open on OK; Done submits through the TV key grid.
- About keeps the installed package version separate from the YouTube frontend version and recognizes the runtime client-version field when present.
- OLED surface gradients no longer cover true-black backgrounds. Styling remains scoped; media, artwork, captions, focus and the independent player scrim are not targeted. Full YouTube surface coverage still needs device testing.

### Defaults and migration
- 2.9.1 introduces no settings-schema migration and changes no automatic-check or automatic-download preference. Existing explicit choices remain unchanged.

### Fixed
- **Installer results are confirmed against installed package metadata.** A successful result is polled but never trusted alone; cancellation keeps the verified APK ready for an explicit retry.
- **Updater failures retain an actionable phase.** Check, download, APK validation and install failures remain distinct; final APK revalidation failures remain classified as validation failures.

### Known limitations
- **No Android build or device verification.** This environment lacks Java/Javac, D8 and Android SDK tooling. No signed 2.9.1 APK, PackageInstaller exercise, in-place upgrade, TV navigation, OLED viewport matrix or cache behavior run exists.
- **Custom-scheme dispatch is not accepted as working.** JavaScript tests prove only that the two exact `ytark://` URLs are assigned; manifest tests prove only intent-filter declarations. The pinned Cobalt runtime has not been shown to hand either route to Android. The Settings Updates card remains read-only; no `window.ytarkUpdater` bridge is registered.
- The release remains ARMv7-only on TizenTubeCobalt v2.0.2. The complete YouTube OLED surface matrix and Google TV system IME remain device-unverified; the DPAD key grid remains the input fallback.

### Validation
- Candidate test, build and device evidence is recorded in `docs/SETTINGS-2.9.1-REVIEW.md`. This entry is unpublished; no release or tag has been created.

## Unpublished drafts and other tags

- `2.9.0` / `v2.9.0` / versionCode `2090000` / userscript `s28` was an unpublished draft in the source tree, never a published Android release. It was superseded before publication by this `2.9.1` candidate; no published tag or APK was moved or relabeled.
- `v2.2.0-probeJ` and `v2.2.0-probeK` are draft releases without assets, created on 2026-10-11 while diagnosing the 2.2 publication pipeline. They were never published and are not versions.
- `s5` to `s13` are userscript tags pushed on 2026-10-09 while the first build pipeline was set up; no published APK used them. Each later `sNN` tag belongs to the release that lists it above.
- The 2.0.3-ytark.15 release notes described automatic update prompts; later releases narrowed that claim until the native updater's device path is verified.

## Upstream base and inherited capabilities

- Android and Cobalt base: TizenTubeCobalt v2.0.2 (synced with Cobalt 27 LTS), changed by YTArk only through repackaging, branding, the userscript address and the native updater.
- Inherited from the TizenTube userscript (GPL-3.0-only): client-side ad blocking, SponsorBlock with segment markers, DeArrow, video queueing, preferred quality, speed and codec, sidebar ordering, startup destination, the clock, inactivity screen dimming, watched-video filtering and player button controls. YTArk maintains and extends them but did not create them.
- The YouTube TV frontend, sign-in, playback and account features come from YouTube's own service.
